                Isle of Dogs is the one new movie you should definitely watch this weekend
Fans of Wes Anderson, rejoice! The prolific director's newest flick,¬†Isle of Dogs, is hitting theaters today.
In addition to Anderson's latest piece of stop-motion animation, our very own movie critic¬†Joshua Rothkopf¬†suggests watching four other relatively new films¬†in the upcoming days (if you haven't yet, of course).
Grab your MoviePass and head to the nearest theater‚Äîhere are the five movies to watch this weekend:
Wes Anderson‚Äôs latest piece of stop-motion animation after Fantastic Mr. Fox brings the quirk (naturally) but weds it to a timely story of refugee camaraderie. Local theaters; opens Fri 23 Read our full review
Same-sex high school attraction gets the modern treatment it deserves in this winning adaptation of a widely read YA novel. It‚Äôs that rare movie that improves upon its source. Local theaters; now playing  Read our full review

A film about extremely wealthy Connecticut teens with bad impulses, this comedy has a steely sheen. While you‚Äôre howling at how mean it is, shed a tear for the late Anton Yelchin, giving his final (and best) performance. Local theaters; now playing Read our full review

                The second season of 13 Reasons Why will include a warning video
Back in March of 2017, when 13 Reasons Why‚Äîa TV show based on the eponymous 2007 novel written by Jay Asher¬†discussing teen suicide, violence and rape‚Äîpremiered on Netflix, discussions erupted both online and off regarding the way that such sensitive material was presented and dealt with on screen. Did the episodes embrace and glorify suicide? Did they elicit the sort of conversations that could potentially prevent such tragedies from occurring or did they seem to promise fame and screen time to¬†a youth battling psychological traumas?¬†
Gearing up for the premiere of the show's second season (no¬†debut date has been yet announced), Netflix released the results of a study commissioned alongside¬†Northwestern University's Center on Media and Human Development¬†whose objective was to analyze the show's impact on its younger viewers.
The results of the research led to one major update ahead of the new episodes: At the start of each new season, viewers will now be treated to a custom intro featuring the show's cast‚Äîall out of character‚Äîdiscussing how to get support for the issues¬†presented on the show. The streaming giant also announced the premiere of a new after show that will feature "actors, experts and educators who helped inform [the show's] approach" and a viewing guide on 13ReasonsWhy.info "to help parents and teens start these tough conversations."
Here are some interesting¬†highlights¬†from the report‚Äîwhich you can read in full right here:

                This map shows where the highest paid people in the country live
Ah, money‚Äîwhere¬†does it live?¬†According to an interactive map developed by Property Shark, a real estate site, the folks that earn most money across the country live in (drum roll, please) New York City's Greenwich Village and Soho areas. Picture us not surprised.
The company analyzed 2016 census data to come up with both the map and a list of the 100 highest-earning zip codes in the country. It then measured a zip code's median home price to figure out whether or not the folks earning most money actually live in the most expensive areas. Interestingly enough... That's not the case!
Here is what the report came up with:- The majority of the priciest zip codes are on the West Coast- The majority of the highest earning zip codes are on the East Coast- Only 27 of the most expensive zip codes rank within the 100 highest-earning ones
What does that all mean? The richest people in the country don't necessarily live in the country's priciest neighborhoods.

Below, we highlight the nominees in the Restaurant and Chef Awards categories. Want to scroll through the entire list, including the design, book and journalism categories? Check it out right here.

                Students around the country are protesting gun violence during today's National School Walkout
Students¬†activists¬†nationwide¬†are raising awareness about gun violence today, hoping to spur lawmakers into action, during the #Enough National School Walkout.
Happening on the one-month anniversary of the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida‚Äîwhen a former student used a legally purchased AR-15 rifle to shoot and kill 17 people‚Äîthe event is organized by the youth¬†arm of Women's March‚Äîthe nonprofit behind the January 2017 and 2018 demonstrations.
Over 2,8000 walkouts are scheduled across the country at 10am in each time zone.
The Parkland students, who have been actively pursuing gun reforms since the school shooting, are also organizing March For Our Lives, a protest that will take place on March 24 in Washington, D.C. calling for gun violence legislation.
Here are some images of the walkouts that have already occurred across the country:¬†
Alabama School for the Blind #NationalSchoolWalkout Looking around at all of the innocent faces of the kids I would do anything for, I can‚Äôt imagine the horror those victims in Parkland, Sandy Hook, Orlando, Aurora, Las Vegas, Virginia Tech, Columbine, and the countless other places mass shootings have taken place must have felt. No child should EVER have to fear for their life when they go to school to learn. #TimesUp for the killing. #NeverAgain #Enough #GunReformNow
